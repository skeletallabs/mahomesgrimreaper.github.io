### How did Patrick Mahomes earn the nickname Grim Reaper?

After an epic battle between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills in what some
have called the greatest game of all time, the Chiefs were left with
13 seconds to drive into field goal range. Before the drive, Andy Reid told Patrick Mahomes
"When it's grim, be the Grim Reaper." And he listened, driving 55 yards in 10 seconds, leaving just enough time for a game-tying field goal. The Chiefs would go on to win in overtime.
